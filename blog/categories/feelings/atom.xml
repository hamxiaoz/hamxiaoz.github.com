    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not too late for 2013, so here are my 2013 resolution and principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Read books, not news</strong>.<br/>
  &ldquo;The news media are, for the most part, the bringers of bad news&rdquo;, and bad news is negative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build things</strong>.<br/>
  Hack and make.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay fit</strong>.<br/>
  Trying to be a <u>brogrammer</u>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay <del>late</del></strong>.<br/>
  No one thinks waking up too early is bad, but everyone suggests not staying up too late.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better at English</strong>.<br/>
  Improve the ability to communicate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn singing</strong>.<br/>
  Why not?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>共勉之.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/142550">this post</a> made hackernews top 10. I guess it has to do with the fact that a lot of readers have the experience of blowing into the Nintendo cartridges before.</p>

<p>I blew several of them too.</p>

<p>I was lucky, as my parents would buy me the &ldquo;Nintendo game console&rdquo;. Well technically, it was called &ldquo;小霸王学习机&rdquo; at that time and was intended to help kids learning. As learning is always a good excuse for playing (&ldquo;Mom, I need to buy a walkman to learn English&rdquo;), it turned out most of the time, the machine was used to play games.
At that time, a game cartridge was really expensive: one 8-in-1 cartridge (yeah, pirated, I know) almost cost 100 yuan, about the same amount of the console itself. It turned out as a kid, you could only owned up to 3 or 4 game cartridges. Sure it sounds sad, but on the other hand, every game was treated as &ldquo;Contra&rdquo; or &ldquo;Super Mario&rdquo;. We played hard and found fun.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, people have access to more games and more consoles. Thanks for people who cracking games and consoles (PS3, wii, psp, xbox), it&rsquo;s very easy to grab a game from tpb, burn to a disk, or even just transfer to a hard drive, play for a while and find boring. (well I am describing the process, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean I&rsquo;m doing it or I did that)</p>

<p>The fact is, it&rsquo;s not the game is not fun, it&rsquo;s the people who playing it couldn&rsquo;t find the fun. Games are too easy to get/own, and if you are used to live in this &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; world, you will treat them as fast food. You always want to play it quickly, you always want to upgrade to full xp/mp quickly, you always want to see the end, you always want to try the next game. It&rsquo;ll be quick to find out you have already owned all the games you &ldquo;like&rdquo;, but which one do you really like?</p>

<p>Probably the next one.</p>

<p>Time is fast, life is fast, but do take it slow. Treasure what you have, and enjoy the moment.</p>

<p>&#13;</p>

<p>其实在美国有一点不好，不能够在第一时间去欣赏和支持国产大片。</p>


<p>&#13;</p>

<p>美国电影虽好，特效虽强，但是故事，演员，总感觉不是自己一路的。心里也没有那种共鸣。</p>


<p>&#13;</p>

<p>我想，这就是所谓的文化差异吧。</p>


<p>&#13;
&#13;</p>

<p>PS: 电影不错，值得一看。黄秋生的配音实在NB，查了下，原来是著名配音张济平。</p>
