    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you, Netflix, for letting me know that I really need to read the "terms and conditions" before signing up any **FREE** service. The customer service told me that I was not qualify for the **FREE** trial, but on the day I signed up, there is absolutely NO sign of that. I naively believed I was enjoying the **FREE** trial.</p>


<p>&#13;
&#13;</p>

<p>Thank you, Netflix, for teaching me to keep an eye on my credit card statement, because you charged my card without sending me ANY email confirmation/notification. You're just charged monthly, smoothly, and silently.</p>


<p>&#13;
&#13;</p>

<p>I should have known that Netflix is not a good service company <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-introduces-new-plans-and.html">on the day they changed their plan and screwed their existing customers.</a> I should be alert when I saw <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html">their CEO's apology</a>. Question: when does a CEO stand up and apologize for the company?  Answer: when they f**ked up their customers, big time.</p>


<p>&#13;

<p>Thank you, Netflix, for giving me a chance to rant on the internet.</p>

I hear you only send these cards to not-yet-a-member-customer, and yes, you're pretty close to get one onboard. So keep trying!&lt;/p&gt; " /></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thank you, the ups man, for trying to delivery my Amazon order three times and finally got it done on the 3rd time. I know my place is not very close to the street and you have to climb up some stairs and take a long walk to my door. Not to mention my order is a <strong>50</strong> pounds box, and you tried three times. Let me hope you just didn't say the opposite words "xxxx you" every time.</p>
