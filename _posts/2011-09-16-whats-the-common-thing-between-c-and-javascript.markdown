title: What's the common thing between C# and Javascript？
---

<p>Q. What's the common thing between C# and Javascript？</p>&#13;
<p>A. They are almost available every where:</p>&#13;
<p>- you can do front-end web programming in JavaScript (no doubt), and back-end web programming in Javascript too (Node.js)</p>&#13;
<p>- you can do desktop programming in C# on windows/linux/mac. (thru mono)</p>&#13;
<p>- you can do mobile programming in C# on windows mobile/iOS/Android (thru monotouch/monodroid)</p>&#13;
<p>- you can do game programming in C# on xbox360/window mobile/iOS/Android, and even PS Vita!! (overlapping sound: nani?!) Actually, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fastchicken.co.nz/2011/09/15/c-its-just-not-portable/">this</a> for more details.</p>&#13;
<p><span>And on the latest windows 8, you could create apps in </span>JavaScript<span> or C#. (singing "whatever you like")</span></p>&#13;
<p>Time to study JavaScript...</p>
