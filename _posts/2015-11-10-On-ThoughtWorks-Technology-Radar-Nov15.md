I enjoy reading the monthly technology radar from ThoughtWorks. It keeps you update with the trend, because Software industry is like Fashion: 

> New things are coming out everyday, while classic keeps classic.

Here are some ideas about the latest edition: [Technology Radar Nov '15](https://assets.thoughtworks.com/assets/technology-radar-nov-2015-en.pdf)

---

#### Techniques
- Generated infrastructure diagrams
> Interesting, using API to generate diagrams from cloud infrastructures. Sounds like a startup idea.

- NoPSD
> Yes, everybody is loving Sketch. And who doesn't know HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript now?  
I'll predict **Full Stack Designer** will be the next hot title.

- Products over projects
> I think we're all making products instead of _projects_ as long as the output is used by human. 

- BEM
> Naming convention for CSS. I like this because I'm a fan of coding standard/naming convention. They exist for better communication.

- BFF - Backend for frontends
> It's like 'responsive backend design'? Any examples?

- Event Storming
>  “outside-in” domain modeling. This is interesting.

- Flux
> I think the philosophy behind React.js and Flux makes sense. It reduces complexity and makes things easy to reason about. I like it.

- NPM for all the things
> We just have invented too many tools, now it's time to simplify things.

- Offline first web applications
> Yes, web applications are more like 'native' applications now. Actually, nowadays do we really care it's a 'web' application or 'native' application? The gap is shrinking. Exiting.

- Bug bounties
> Money is not always the best incentive, but it's usually a good one. See [WeChat Red Envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat_red_envelope)


#### Tools

- Composer
> Who doesn't want dependency management?

- Postman
> Good tool.

- Gitrob
> [Be careful](http://jordan-wright.com/blog/2014/12/30/why-deleting-sensitive-information-from-github-doesnt-save-you/) when you commit your password/API key to public. I like the name too.

- RAML
> Spec for API. Interesting. In our hands, we have "apps, apps, and apps". In the cloud, we have "API, API and API". I guess we do need a spec.

- Visual Studio Code
> It's built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). Using web technology to build cross platform products is the future IMHO. I've tried Node-WebKit (now [nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/)) and it has been good.


#### Platforms

- AWS Lambda
> There is a called the 'serverless trend'

- SPDY
> You should look at HTTP/2 

#### Languages & Frameworks

- ECMAScript 6
> I was using CoffeeScript but now I start using ES6. Check my work-in-progress [Coffeescript to ES6 Cheatsheet](https://hamxiaoz.gitbooks.io/notes/content/coffeescript%20to%20es6.html)

- Nancy
> Although I don't use .net for web, but it's good to know. I like its idea of being ["Low ceremony"](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Introduction).
