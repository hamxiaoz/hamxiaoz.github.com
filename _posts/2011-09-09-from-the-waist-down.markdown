title: From the waist down
---

<p>It's hard to believe, but from waist down, my muscle sucks. I mean, <strong>real</strong> muscle.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>My thigh gets really sore after 30 squat jumps, my calf muscle is really complaining after jumping rope for 80 turns...</p>&#13;
<p>Muscles from waist up, on the other hand, is way better.</p>&#13;
<p>The reason?</p>&#13;
<p>- I sit in front of the computer for a loooooong time every day. Lower body seldom moves.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The solution?</p>&#13;
<p>- Watch Wall-E, and decide go hiking, running, or walking.Â </p>
