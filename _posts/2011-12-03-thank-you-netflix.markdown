title: Thank You, Netflix
---

<p>Thank you, Netflix, for letting me know that I really need to read the "terms and conditions" before signing up any **FREE** service. The customer service told me that I was not qualify for the **FREE** trial, but on the day I signed up, there is absolutely NO sign of that. I naively believed I was enjoying the **FREE** trial.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you, Netflix, for teaching me to keep an eye on my credit card statement, because you charged my card without sending me ANY email confirmation/notification. You're just charged monthly, smoothly, and silently.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I should have known that Netflix is not a good service company <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-introduces-new-plans-and.html">on the day they changed their plan and screwed their existing customers.</a> I should be alert when I saw <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html">their CEO's apology</a>. Question: when does a CEO stand up and apologize for the company?  Answer: when they f**ked up their customers, big time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you, Netflix, for giving me a chance to rant on the internet.</p>
