<div id="msgcns!5F971C000415D85F!105" class="bvMsg">1. Proceed in C# and study Date Structure. 2. Recite GRE words again and never again. 3. How about Oral English? 4. Try to remember something studied in my 4 years campus life. 5. Visa, Visa... 6. UCI? UCI. UCI! UCI!! 7. GTD? Money? LyMe? 8. The last is not the least. A secret personal training is in progress...... Isn't isÂ funny? I hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody... However, a ringing phone has to be answered.
