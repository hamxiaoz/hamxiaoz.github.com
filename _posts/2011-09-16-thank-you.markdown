title: Thank You, UPS
---

<p>Thank you, the ups man, for trying to delivery my Amazon order three times and finally got it done on the 3rd time. I know my place is not very close to the street and you have to climb up some stairs and take a long walk to my door. Not to mention my order is a <strong>50</strong> pounds box, and you tried three times. Let me hope you just didn't say the opposite words "xxxx you" every time.</p>
