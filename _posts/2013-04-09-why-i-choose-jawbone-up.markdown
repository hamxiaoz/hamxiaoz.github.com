Why I choose Jawbone Up over Nike Fuelband and Fitbit Flex?

- No Nike Fuelband because it displays 'points': I'd like to get accurate information. I want to feel 'control'. The obscure 'fuel points' is out of my control and what's the algorithm? Nike Fuelband is out in the first round.

- I want a sleep tracker. Both Jawbone Up and Fitbit Flex have a tie in the second round.

- I want an vibrating alarm so when I get up [early](http://hamxiaoz.com/blog/2013/01/19/2013-resolution/) I won't wake up my beloved one. They both have it. Still deciding...

- I want an idle alarm so I get notified if I sit for too long. Also, it's nice to use it as ['pomodoro'](http://www.pomodorotechnique.comments/) timer (I set it to 45 minutes at work). Now the winer is:
