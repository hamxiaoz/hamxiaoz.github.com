I guess it's not too late for 2013, so here are my 2013 resolution and principles:

- **Read books, not news**.  
    "The news media are, for the most part, the bringers of bad news", and bad news is negative.

- **Build things**.  
    Hack and make.

- **Stay fit**.  
    Trying to be a <u>brogrammer</u>.

- **Stay ~~late~~**.  
    No one thinks waking up too early is bad, but everyone suggests not staying up too late.

- **Better at English**.  
    Improve the ability to communicate.

- **Learn singing**.  
    Why not?
