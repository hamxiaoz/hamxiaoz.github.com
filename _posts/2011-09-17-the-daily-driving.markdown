title: The daily driving
---

<p>I realized why my car had only 18.5 mpg... because the car maker is totally advertising correctly: "city 18 and highway 28". And I'm mostly driving locally.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These two days I saw 2 Nissan Leaf on the road. "Zero emission" is cool, but the look of the car is really not my style. What's the best looking electric car out there? BMW Active E, for sure.</p>
